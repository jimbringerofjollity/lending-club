    "The purpose of this data science project is to come up with a classification model for loans that get approved on Lending Club. Lenders on Lending Club suspect they may not be maximizing their profits, relative to what's optimal. They also do not have a strong sense of what borrower features matter the most in determining credit-worthiness. This project aims to build a classification model for potential borrowers based on various numerical and categorical data. This model will be used to provide guidance for banks and other moneylenders."
