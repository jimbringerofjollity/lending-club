\begin{frame}{Problem Identification}
What properties of a borrower make a loan more likely to be fully paid? charged
off?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Context: 
Moneylending is potentially very lucrative because many kinds of
business like real estate, etc. leverage money from loans as starting capital.
However, lending money to noncreditworthy borrowers is very costly.
\item Criteria for success: When determining whether a loan will be charged off,
\begin{itemize}
\item have a low false positive rate (don't deny profitable loans)
\item have a very low false negative rate (want to get paid back)
\end{itemize}
\item Scope of solution space: The focus will be on various data 
about borrowers and their loan requests. We will be looking at
loans through Lending Club.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problem Identification}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item Constraints within solution space:
\begin{itemize}
\item The data may not be up to date (it is 10 years old)
\item Insights may not apply to borrowers in other countries
\end{itemize}
\item Stakeholders to provide key insight:
\begin{itemize}
\item Banks
\item Pawnbrokers
\end{itemize}
\item Key data sources:
data.world dataset about loans issued by lendingclub.com from 2007-2011
with performance data -- contains complete loan data for all loans issued
through the time period stated, including the current loan status (Current,
Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Recommendation and key findings}
\begin{itemize}
\item
We are able to determine the four traits most strongly associated with
fully paid loans. They are high mean FICO score, high annual income, 
credit card related purpose, and debt consolidation related purpose.
\item
We are also able to determine the four traits most strongly
associated with charged off loans. They are longer term loans, inquiries
within the last six months, credit utilization rate, and small business
related purpose.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Summary and conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
\item The most creditworthy features are
high mean FICO score, high annual income, 
credit card related purpose, and debt consolidation related purpose.

\item The most subprime features are
longer term loans, inquiries within the last six months,
credit utilization rate, and small business related purpose.

\item Other important features determining loan status are monthly debt to
income ratio, total credit balance, and loan grade.
\end{itemize}
